            <h2>A successful Pixelz Cup tournament</h2>
            <img alt="" src="https://gallery.mailchimp.com/c797a756660f10999683275c6/images/d9ebc3e6-74fa-4afd-b918-085d106670c7.jpg">

            <p>The finals in Danang were held earlier than the Hanoi’s. 60 minutes playing in 2 half seems not enough to determine who is the Champion between Techsup team and Looklet team. After a 1-1 draw in the main match, the game goes into a penalty shootout. Finally, Techsup Da Nang team won the Champion Cup and "offer" Looklet the Silver Medal.</p>

            <p>After nearly two months of exciting competition, Pixelz Cup 2018 in Hanoi also officially ended with the battle between two teams TOP A and BETTELENHE. Both teams had their own way of playing with the technical style that made the spectators and supporters excited when lashing many shots into the net of opponents. Finally, thanks to the solidarity, the calmness and the cheers from supporters, the 18 carat gold trophy embossed letters of Pixelz Cup belonged to T.O.P A team by a final score of 4-1. And it is a bit of pity for BETTELENHE FC that they can only won the silver medal.</p>

            <p>A total of 20 matches were played and 107 goals were scored. The QA 2 & Richy third place playoff was really interesting and peaceful as the two teams took the bronze medal together - an unprecedented thing of Hanoi Pixelz Cup. This is the proof for the good co-worker relationship between departments in this year tournament.</p>

In addition, Bui Van Tuyen, the athlete who won many prestigious medals at the 2018 Disability Sports Championship and received a certificate of merit from organization board, is also a factor contribute to the success of Pixelz sports champions.</p>
